			<p>Good Day! My name is Lois Meek L. Fernandez
			and welcome to my Website!</p>
			<p style="margin-left: 40px">If I were to describe my self, I am a very simple person to be exact.
			I love simplicity, I don't like extravagant things. When it comes to people, 
			I am the quiet and mother-like type of friend. I like taking care of others.
			I love helping and supporting people especially the people that I'm closed with.
			My hobbies consist of Dancing to hip hop or any song that is catchy or
			famous at the moment "HAHAHAHAHAH". I also love singing but my voice is just
			average *sad laughing* And also I love reading books, especially mystery novels
			or series like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson Series, or the Demonata Series by Darren shan
			(I haven't finished this series,because of schoolworks (ಥ﹏ಥ);) If you want 
			to know more about me please click the Biodata button above! </p>

			<p>"Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss...
			but every once in a while, you find someone who's iridescent. And when 
			you do, nothing will ever compare"</p>
